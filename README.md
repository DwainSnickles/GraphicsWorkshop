# Graphics Workshop
A grahics workstation used to edit grahics and create objects to be added to a design surface where objects can be placed in certain positions along with object rotation.
This app is not complete and is a work in progress.
I made it public so if any one is interested in contributing please let me know.
I started this project several years ago in VB.net but since the switched to C#.
Hence inclusion of VB.net and C#.
Some of this code was taken from various sites such as Github.com and Codeproject.com and various other sources.
A special thanks to stackoverflow.com for a wealth of help and knoweldge.
If any see the code to be like theirs feel free to let me know and I will include them in credits.
Note at this time once text object is added to the designer

1) Left click the object and drag to the desired location

2) Right click hold and rotate object using the mouse.
